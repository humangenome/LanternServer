# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you have found a security issue in Beacon (the server, client plugin, launcher, or admin API), please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Report it privately through GitHub: **https://github.com/HumanGenome/BeaconServer/security/advisories/new**

That form is monitored and is the only reporting channel. Reports open a private thread with the maintainer, and you can be credited on the advisory when it is published.

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected component (server / plugin / launcher / API)
- Beacon version
- Whether the issue is currently being exploited

Reports are acknowledged within 72 hours and triaged within 7 days.

## Scope

In scope:
- Remote code execution or unauthenticated takeover of `BeaconServer.exe`
- Authentication bypass on join handshake, RCON, or admin API
- IPC injection through the plugin / BeaconServer named pipe
- Save file corruption that lets a connected client write arbitrary host files
- Privilege escalation through plugin hooks

Out of scope:
- Hardware-host vulnerabilities (those belong to your hosting provider)
- Vulnerabilities in retail Subnautica 2 itself (report to Krafton)
- Vulnerabilities in third-party mods running on Beacon
- Anti-cheat / cheating concerns — Beacon does not provide anti-cheat
